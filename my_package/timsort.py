Timsort Function
----------------
As the sorting functions are tailored for the project,
a key is needed to access the value in the dictionaries in the list of records.

Timsort, a sorting algorithm that took me over a week to implement
At least it was worth the trouble, I had fun doing it :P

It's performance was clearly above regular sorts,
especially when the array is partially sorted.

Timsort really performs tremendously better then regular merge sort
My test code for verifying that is in test_tim.py

Resources I had to go through to understand timsort:
(This is but just half of it)
