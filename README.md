## Project Details

**Author:** Jabriel Seah
**Why the image:** I was dying while doing the project
**Why Honkai Impact 3rd:** Why not? :P
**Where did you get the images:**
- The 2 seeles were from [here](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/77771464)
- Blood was edited from [this image](https://www.cleanpng.com/png-blood-drawing-clip-art-blood-splatter-png-587073/)
- Others were stripped from emojis in [Honkai Impact 3rd Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/hi3)

## Project Description

This is a hotel booking records application made for my Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment.
It can display, sort, search and update records.
Since it was for the sake of the assignment, many not-as-effecient sorting algorithms were used.
We could add our own features/aglorithms/data structures that would help improve our application.
That's when my friends and I went crazy, and also the cause of my death.
Also, quick sort and merge sort are not considered advanced algorithms due to them being thought in class already.

## Requirements

**Python Version:** 3.7 and above required

## Algorithms and Data Structures Implemented

### Required Features

- Bubble sort algorithm
- Selection sort algorithm
- Insertion sort algorithm
- Linear search algorithm
- Binary search algorithm

### Advanced Features

- Binary insertion sort algorithm
- Counting sort algorithm
- LSD Radix sort algorithm
- KMP pattern searching algorithm
- AVL Binary Search Tree
- Timsort algorithm
- Custom sort algorithm

## Conclusion

Timsort was a hell to learn due to me attempting to understand how every part of it worked
(it was especially hard for me to understand how did `powerloop` using `powersort` worked).
In the end I wasn't able to implement the galloping mode for timsort due to lack of time.
I might implement it if I have time later (and also if I am still willing to do it).
Also, I wish I could've implemented/learn even more cool algorithms like Boyer–Moore algorithm, Aho-Corasick algorithm, Introsort.

### Final words

> You should play Honkai Impact 3rd.
