**Why the image:** I was dying while doing the project  
**Why Honkai Impact 3rd:** Why not? :P  
**Where did you get the images:**

## Project Description

### TL;DR

This is a hotel booking records application made for my Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment.
It can display, sort, search and update records.
Since it was for the sake of the assignment, many not-as-effecient sorting algorithms were used.
We could add our own features/aglorithms/data structures that would help improve our application.
That's when my friends and I went crazy, and also the cause of my death.
Also, quick sort and merge sort are not considered advanced algorithms due to them being thought in class already.

### Staycation Package Deals Inventory

The purpose of the system is to allow a renowned hotel to manage the Staycation booking records for the packages they offered. They can display and update staycation booking records from the system. User can perform searching and sorting of records. You would need to apply knowledge from the practical sessions to complete this assignment.

1. Design a suitable data structure (e.g. by making use of Python list, dictionary, objects, etc.) to manage the staycation booking records. You are required to store the following staycation booking records. Each record has: Package Name, Customer Name, number of pax and Package Cost per pax.
2. The data structure will store up to 10 records. All records are to be pre-initialized in the program.
3. Design a menu for the application to allow the user to perform the following:
Display all records
    1. Sort record by Customer Name using Bubble sort
    2. Sort record by Package Name using Selection sort
    3. Sort record by Package Cost using Insertion sort
    4. Search record by Customer Name using Linear Search and update record
    5. Search record by Package Name using Binary Search and update record
    6. List records range from $X to $Y. e.g $100-200
    7. Exit Application
4. All sorting algorithms are in ascending order only. After sorting, the record will be stored as sorted order for next display.
5. All search algorithms MUST ignore case sensitivity. Upon update, the updated record will be stored.
6. Error handling is required.
7. User friendly interface and design

**Bonus features**  
Student may add any other algorithms/features that are not covered in this module and is/are useful for the application. To score well, student must research for advanced algorithms and apply it effectively for this assignment.

## Requirements

**Python Version:** 3.7 and above required

## Algorithms and Data Structures Implemented

### Required Features

- Bubble sort algorithm
- Selection sort algorithm
- Insertion sort algorithm
- Linear search algorithm
- Binary search algorithm

### Advanced Features

- Binary insertion sort algorithm
- Counting sort algorithm
- LSD Radix sort algorithm
- KMP pattern searching algorithm
- AVL Binary Search Tree
- Timsort algorithm
- Custom sort algorithm

## Conclusion

Timsort was a hell to learn due to me attempting to understand how every part of it worked
(it was especially hard for me to understand how did `powerloop` using `powersort` worked)
(it also took a long time for me to implement galloping functionality).
Also, I wish I could've implemented/learn even more cool algorithms like Boyer–Moore algorithm, Aho-Corasick algorithm, Introsort.

### Final words

> You should play Honkai Impact 3rd.
